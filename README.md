Kataba is an AI-powered educational tool that provides educators with deep insights into their lectures. 
Kataba is easily accessible as it allows educators to record their lectures with a click of a button. It uses speech recognition software to transcribe lectures and then extract facts from this transcript. It also allows educators to set their metrics by providing their own questions.

Kataba heavily uses Artificial Intelligence to replicate a typical student's cognition in a particular lecture and provides an unbiased feedback system to educators. Apart from merely answering questions set by educators, the model also provides a confidence score for each answer, 
which helps educators understand how well the majority of the class has interpreted a specific concept.
This feedback can eventually help educators adapt their teaching style and enhance their lectures.
